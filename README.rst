Testing
=======
The easiest way to run the test suite is with nose.

  pip install nose
  nosetests

If freshen is installed, you can also run the features.  You'll need libyaml
dev libs to install freshen successfully.

  pip install freshen
  nosetests --with-freshen

If there is some problem, it's easiest to debug by adding some options.

  nosetests --with-freshen -v -s
