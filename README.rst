embedly-python
==============
Python Library for interacting with Embedly's API and Embedly Pro.

WARNING: This is alpha code. Expect it to change before a 0.1 is released.

Install
=======
Basic install directions::

  git clone git@github.com:embedly/embedly-python
  sudo python setup.py

Getting Started
===============
Basic usage::

  >>> from embedly import Embedly
  >>> client = Embedly()
  >>> obj = client.oembed('http://instagr.am/p/BL7ti/')
  >>> obj.type
  u'photo'
  >>> obj['type']
  u['photo']
  >>> obj.url
  u'http://distillery.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2011/01/24/cdd759a319184cb79793506607ff5746_7.jpg'

  >>> obj = client.oembed('http://instagr.am/p/error')
  >>> obj.error
  True

Testing
=======
The easiest way to run the test suite is with nose::

    pip install nose
    nosetests

If freshen is installed, you can also run the features.  You'll need libyaml
dev libs to install freshen successfully::

    pip install freshen
    nosetests --with-freshen

If there is some problem, it's easiest to debug by adding some options::

    nosetests --with-freshen -v -s
